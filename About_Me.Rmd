## About Me

My name is Selim Coskunuzer. I am a junior at Liberty High School located in Dallas, Texas. I am passionate about Computer Science and Machine Learning.

## About the Project

I came up with this project idea because I been watching American football for some time now and I wanted to calculate the difference in players salaries by their position to see if there was a significant difference. I hope with this information NFL coaches, fans, etc. can see that these players will be getting paid more in the future as time goes on.
