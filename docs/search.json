I am passionate about Computer Science and\r\nMachine Learning.\r\nAbout the Project\r\nI came up with this project idea because I been watching American\r\nfootball for some time now and I wanted to calculate the difference in\r\nplayers salaries by their position to see if there was a significant\r\ndifference. I hope with this information NFL coaches, fans, etc. can see\r\nthat these players will be getting paid more in the future as time goes\r\non.\r\nContact Info\r\nEmail: scoskunuzer@gmail.com\r\nGithub: https://github.com/SelimC06\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

From the graph we can interpret that all positions are\r\ngetting near equal average salary but the increase and decrease for all\r\npositions is extremely different from each other, for example\r\nStrong Safety increased by 200% in 2016. Also the\r\nlowest average salary in 2020, cornerback, is an important part of the\r\ndefensive side but still they are getting paid lower than any other. If\r\nyou like to see each player’s salary by year you can interact with the\r\nplot below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I\r\ngathered that data and organized it into three categories, offense,\r\ndefense, and special team but some category (special teams) might have\r\nless players than other category which is the reason it is a lot lower\r\nthan others. In conclusion I noticed that in the graph each category has\r\nincreased average salary over the years so we can predict in the future\r\nthat salaries of NFL players will keep increasing past 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The main reason why the average salary of\r\nQuarterbacks compared to the other positions is a\r\ntremendous amount is because quarterbacks require a ton of skills and\r\nthey are known as the leader for the offense category. In conclusion we\r\ncan estimate that the quarterback’s salary will keep increasing yearly\r\nand the other positions will slowly increase behind.
