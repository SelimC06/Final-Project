I am passionate about Computer Science and\r\nMachine Learning.\r\nAbout the Project\r\nI came up with this project idea because I been watching American\r\nfootball for some time now and I wanted to calculate the difference in\r\nplayers salaries by their position to see if there was a significant\r\ndifference. I hope with this information NFL coaches, fans, etc. can see\r\nthat these players will be getting paid more in the future as time goes\r\non.\r\nContact Info\r\nEmail: scoskunuzer@gmail.com\r\nGithub: https://github.com/SelimC06\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

From the graph we can interpret that all positions are\r\ngetting near equal average salary but the increase and decrease for all\r\npositions is extremely different from each other, for example\r\nStrong Safety increased by 200% in 2016. Also the\r\nlowest average salary in 2020, cornerback, is an important part of the\r\ndefensive side but still they are getting paid lower than any other. If\r\nyou like to see each player’s salary by year you can interact with the\r\nplot below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I gathered that data\r\nand organized it into three category, offense, defense, and special\r\nteam. Some category might have less players than another category that’s\r\nwhy special teams is a lot below offense and defense. In conclusion I\r\nnoticed that in the graph each category has increased average salary\r\nover the years so we can predict in the future that salaries of NFL\r\nplayers will keep increasing past 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this graph I put 5 of the most important positions in the\r\nOffensive side because the others had very low average or were not as\r\nimportant. The main reason why the average salary of Quarterbacks\r\ncompared to the other positions is a tremendous amount is because\r\nquarterbacks require a ton of skills and they are known as the leader\r\nfor the offense category. In conclusion we can estimate that the\r\nquarterback’s salary will keep increasing yearly and the other positions\r\nwill slowly increase behind.
